# quickNote
A small notetaking application based on Flask.

The application is heavily inspired by the note app by Alina Chudnova on youtube, but with small differences.

The main difference is the API, that uses POST, but also conveys an action, so only one endpoint is needed. This
is to keep the API-use a bit restish.
